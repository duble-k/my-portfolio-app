# my-portfolio-app
This application written using React/MUI and Firebase Modular SDK is the same code base used for my deployed portfolio website (minus the specifics to me).

## About
Please feel free to use this application as inspiration for your own portfolio. Take pieces of code from it, and make it better! I urge you to not copy directly, that's no fun :)
The app will probably be broken because I removed images and my resume from the 'assets' folder. To have the app working, just put images and a resume in that folder, and update the imports. After that it should run as normal.

## Technical
This app was built using Node v16, and has only been tested with that. It is set up to be used with a Firebase project using a Firestore storage. Please reference the Firestore docs here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore
If you do not feel like having a "guestbook" where visitors can sign after visiting your page and logging into github, then please just remove the GuestBook component and the respective routes.

## Big shout out
Big thanks to Lee Rob for the UI inspiration, you can find his portfolio here: https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io
I did not copy any of his code at all (we used different frameworks and cloud solutions), however his unique design and guestbook were a big motivation for me so thank you, Lee.
